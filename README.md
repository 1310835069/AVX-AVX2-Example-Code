# AVX / AVX2 Intrinsics Example Code

## Quick Start

### Compile

```bash
$ make
```

All the source files in `src/` will be compiled and generate binary files to the `bin/` in each subdirectory.

### Run

Fast compile & run at one time!

Execute this command:

```bash
$ make run
```

At the project root directory, then you can see all the program output on your terminal :tada:

### Clean

It's easy to clean all the output files, just enter the following command at the project root directory:

```bash
$ make clean
```

Then you would find out all the output files are gone away!
